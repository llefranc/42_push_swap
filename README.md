## About

Push_swap is a project of the mandatory part of the cursus.
</br>It's only made in C and was about creating two programs : one sorting two "special" stacks, and another one checking if the stacks are sorted or not. 
</br>We were only allowed to modify the two "stacks", called **stack a** and **stack b**, using a set of instruction : 
- `sa` *(swap a)* -- swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
- `sb` *(swap b)* -- swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements).
- `ss` sa and sb at the same time.
- `pa` *(push a)* -- take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.
- `pb` *(push b)* -- take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.
- `ra` *(rotate a)* -- shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- `rb` *(rotate b)* -- shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
- `rr` -- ra and rb at the same time.
- `rra` *(reverse rotate a)* -- shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The flast element becomes the first one.
- `rrb` *(reverse rotate b)* -- shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The flast element becomes the first one.
- `rrr` -- rra and rrb at the same time.

In order to succeed, a good comprehension of what is **complexity**, and how the best **sorting algorithms** work was necessary. 

### How I solve the project

For small list of integers (< 5) I'm using custom sortings to optimize the number of instructions. For bigger list, I implemented a variant of quicksort algorithm.
</br>My push_swap algorithm is sorting a stack of : 
- 3 numbers in 1 instruction
- 5 numbers in 9 instructions
- 100 numbers in 772 instructions
- 500 numbers in 5357 instructions
</br>*each time average number of insctructions for 100 tests*

### Building and running the project

1. Download/Clone this repo

        git clone https://github.com/lucaslefrancq/42_push_swap.git

2. `cd` into the root directory and run `make`

        cd 42_push_swap
        make

3.  Run `push_swap` with a list of integers in order to print the list of instructions on stdout.
	
		./push_swap 2 1 5 4

4.	Run `checker` with a list of integers to solve manually the stack. It will wait for instruction on stdin. Ctrl+D to stop type instructions
	
		./checker 2 1 5 4


5.	Pipe `push_swap` into `checker` with the same list of integers as argument to see if the output of `push_swap` correctly solved the problem
	
		./push_swap 2 1 5 4 | ./checker 2 1 5 4
